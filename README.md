# MATH-426
University of Alaska Math 426 Numerical Analysis

## Description
This class provided a great introduction to 
Numerical methods and Matlab. Topics include
 direct and iterative solutions of systems of equations, interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations, 
and error analysis. One of my favorite sections in this course came at the end where we compared different methods of quadrature [(Clenshaw-Curtis vs Gauss-Lobotto)](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-426/blob/main/Coursework/WH%2313/StefanoFochesatto%20-%20HW13.pdf).
Learning about Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature was the main inspiration for my final statistics project.
